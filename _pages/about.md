## About Me

Welcome to my personal website. I am a versatile tech professional with experience that bridges academic research and industry innovation. My background spans software development, research, and teaching across healthcare, enterprise, and tech domains.

I am currently a Doctoral Candidate at Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, Scotland. My research is focused on designing and developing transformer-based architectures for video understanding, with a specific emphasis on few-shot action recognition. Through this work, I have successfully achieved state-of-the-art performance on complex datasets like RARP-50.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Software Developer, building full-stack applications using technologies like Python, Django, C#, .NET Core, and SQL. I am passionate about leveraging my expertise in both software engineering and machine learning to build impactful solutions and contribute to the research community.

Please feel free to explore my publications and work.
